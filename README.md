# Heavy Hitters

 implementation of streaming algorithms (Misra-Gries & Lossy Counting) for getting frequent items from data streams.

 
 
Data file should have following format:

n m τ a1 a2 a3 . . . am

where n defines the universe, m the number of items ai in the stream, and τ is an absolute frequency threshold (i.e. φ = τ /m).
